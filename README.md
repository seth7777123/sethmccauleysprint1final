had alots of trouble trying to do this with java so i decided to try it with python
struggling alot if its not one thing its another just so overwhelmed with everything i 
have to do now because im so behind i cant get the flake 8 to run properly and the code wont display unless you click on the file
my java one will be added to you soon its just the gradle and setting that up messed me up its either one or the other sorry its so late 
you dont even have to grade it maybe just tell me whats wrong :(
